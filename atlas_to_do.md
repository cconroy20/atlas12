## 1. vdW -> ABO Transition for Line Broadening

**Status: open.**

**Current implementation:** Classical Unsold formula for van der Waals
broadening of neutral-atom lines.

**Modern alternative:** Anstee, Barklem & O'Mara (ABO) theory provides
tabulated sigma and alpha coefficients that correctly describe the
broadening of neutral-atom lines by H collisions, fitting to ab initio
atomic-structure calculations.  Where ABO data exist they should be used
in preference to Unsold, which is known to systematically under-predict
the broadening of strong metal lines by factors of 2-3.

**Impact:** Most pronounced for strong lines of neutral metals (e.g.,
Na I D, Ca II H and K, Fe I lines) used in abundance analyses.  Moving
from Unsold to ABO can shift derived abundances by 0.1-0.3 dex for
saturated lines.

## 2. Dust Opacity (Dusty Mode)

**Status: open; only relevant if the grid floor drops below ~2400 K.**

The Cond-limit solver depletes the gas phase but adds no grain opacity
(the AMES-Cond limit).  Below ~2400 K the condensate column becomes
optically significant and a Dusty-mode treatment (grain opacity from
the condensed fractions) would be needed.  Settling/microphysics
(BT-Settl/StaticWeather style) is brown-dwarf territory -- out of scope.
